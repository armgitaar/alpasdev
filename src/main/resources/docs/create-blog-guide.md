You're on your way to becoming an Alpas Master! ‚õ∞

<a name="need"></a>
### [What you'll need](#need)

This guide assumes that you have already worked through the [Quick Start](/ENTER PATH) guide where you created a To-Do task list. We will leave out the 
basic setting up of a new project steps in this guide and will be a little more straightforward overall as we expect that you now have mastered 
some Alpas basics. üí™üèΩ

Other than the above, there is nothing else that you will need other than some time. This guide will take you about a half hour to implement if you go for 
straight copy-and-paste with some review to gain understanding of the steps you're taking. 


<div class="border-t mt-8"></div>

### Let's get the blogging started! üìù

<a name="initial-setup"></a>
### [Step 1: Start your project](#initial-setup)

Go to the [Alpas Starter project](https://github.com/alpas/starter) on GitHub and setup your new blog using the stater template. 
Perform the initial steps required to successfully run your base template. 


<a name="create-database"></a>
### [Step 2: Setup your database and blogs table](#create-database)

<div class="ordered-list">

1. Setup a new local database and connect to it from within your project. 
2. Create a new blog entity using `./alpas make:entity blog`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='./alpas make:entity blog'></span>
3. Update the **Blog.kt** entity file to include id, content, created_at, and update_at fields
4. Create a blogs table using `./alpas make:migration create_blogs_table --create=blogs`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='./alpas make:migration create_blogs_table --create=blogs'></span>
5. Migrate your blogs table to your database using `./alpas db:migrate`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='./alpas db:migrate'></span>

</div>

Perfecto! We have the database portion all complete now. Now, let's get into creating routes.

<a name="setup-routes"></a>
### [Step 3: Setup the routes](#setup-routes)

Routes. It's where routing happens! üòÇ

We will create the following routes for our Blog - 

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="16" data-file="src/main/kotlin/controllers/TaskController.kt">

```kotlin
private fun RouteGroup.webRoutesGroup() {
    get("/", BlogController::index).name("welcome")
    get("/<page>", BlogController::pages).name("pages")
    get("blog/<id>/<page>", BlogController::show).name("blog.show")
    get("blog/new", BlogController::new).name("blog.new")
    post("blog/submit", BlogController::submit).name("blog.submit")
    get("blog/edit/<id>", BlogController::edit).name("blog.edit")
    patch("blog/edit/<id>", BlogController::update).name("blog.update")
    delete("blog/<id>", BlogController::delete).name("blog.delete")
}
```
</span>

Notice, we removed the WelcomeController in the routing and will use the BlogController. You can update the WelcomeController 
import to be BlogController and we will create the BlogController in a couple steps. 

Browsing through the different routes, you can easily see what the main user interactions will be on the front-end: 
- Main index / welcome page
- Paging for when your blog has multiple posts - in this exercise we will display 9 posts per page
- Showing the blog post detail page
- Submitting a new blog post
- Enter an Edit mode for blog posts where you update the post's content
- Remove a blog post

Next, let's make a service provider.

<a name="create-service-provider"></a>
### [Step 4: Create service provider](#create-service-provider)

Service providers classes that allow you to register and boot your services in a more controlled way in one central place. 
Our service provider will be simple and assist with making blogs. 

<div class="ordered-list">

1. Use the `./alpas make:provider BlogServiceProvider`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='./alpas make:provider BlogServiceProvider'></span> command to 
create the service provider
2. In the **BlogServiceProvider** file, add `app.bind(Blogs(app.make()))`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='app.bind(Blogs(app.make()))'></span> to the `override fun boot` function
3. Navigate to the **HttpKernal** file and `BlogServiceProvider::class`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='BlogServiceProvider::class'></span> to the list of providers

</div>
 
Let's next code the logic to convert markdown to HTML as well as extract some blog post meta data.

<a name="markdown-convertor"></a>
### [Step 5: Create a markdown convertor](#markdown-convertor)

Our blog will allow a contributer to format content using markdown. Once they save their changes, our code will convert the 
markdown content to HTML. We will also write some logic to read through post headers to extract meta data.  

<div class="ordered-list">

1. Create a new directory under the Kotlin directory named **actions**
2. Under the actions directory, create a new file named **Blogs.kt**
3. Open **Blogs.kt** and add the code from [ENTER GITHUB URL]

</div>

You will notice that we import the Flexmark library. If you didn't know it already, Kotlin is compatible with Java libraries - 
so we can natively pull in and use the best Java based modules out there! 

Be sure to look through the code and the comments to gain a better understanding of the operations being performed.

<a name="create-blogcontroller"></a>
### [Step 6: Create BlogController](#create-blogcontroller)

We are super close! Just a few more steps! In this step we will [create the to-do table and migrate](https://alpas.dev/docs/migrations#main) to the todolist database. 

<div class="ordered-list">

1. Create a new controller using `./alpas make:controller BlogController`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='./alpas make:controller BlogController'></span> 
2. In the newly created **BlogController.kt** file, copy and paste in the code from [ADD GITHUBLINK]

</div>

A lot of the brains are in this file. Read through the code and pay extra attention to the comments. Make sure you have 
a good understanding of what's going on in this file. 

You may notice under the submit function we are referring to a `BlogData` validation rule. This is a custom rule that we will
setup in the next step. 


>/info/
><strong>Related Documentation</string>
>https://alpas.dev/docs/controllers#main
>https://ktorm.liuwj.me/

<a name="validation-rule"></a>
### [Step 7: Create a validation rule](#validation-rule")

There is no out-of-the-box rule to support validating the blog post content. Luckily, it's easy to create a new custom rule 
that can be called to validate a form entry. In this case, we want to validate all of the meta data fields are accounted for and
that there is at least some content in the body of the blog post. 

<div class="ordered-list">

1. Create a new validation rule using the `./alpas make:validation-rule BlogData`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='./alpas make:validation-rule BlogData'></span> command
2. Open up the **BlogData.kt** file and add in the below code
3. After updating the file, don't forget to import the new rule into the **BlogController.kt** file

</div>

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="1" data-file="src/main/kotlin/controllers/TaskController.kt">

```kotlin
package com.blog.blogify.rules

import dev.alpas.validation.ErrorMessage
import dev.alpas.validation.Rule
import dev.alpas.validation.ValidationGuard

class BlogData(private val markData: String, private val title: String, private val author: String, private val date: String, private val image: String, private val tags: String, private val message: ErrorMessage = null) : Rule() {
    override fun check(attribute: String, value: Any?): Boolean {

        val isValid = markData.isNotEmpty() && title.isNotEmpty() && author.isNotEmpty() && date.isNotEmpty() && image.isNotEmpty() && tags.isNotEmpty()

        if (!isValid) {

            error = message?.let { it(attribute, value) } ?: "Submission failed - be sure to fill in all metadata and blog content."
        }
        return isValid
    }
}

fun ValidationGuard.blogData(markData: String, title: String, author: String, date: String, image: String, tags: String, message: ErrorMessage = null): Rule {
    return rule(BlogData(markData, title, author, date, image, tags, message))
}
```

</span>

The rule simply checks to make sure all of the required content is present. As an added exercise, try to see if you can customize the validation to 
tell the front-end exactly which piece(s) failed validation. 

Now all we need to do is create the front-end!

<a name="front-end"></a>
### [Step 8: Create the front-end](#front-end")

For the front-end of the website, we will be using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The Alpas start project already comes pre-installed with 
Alpas. All we need to do is customize it a bit and then apply some classes to create a slick looking interface! For the majority of the step, feel free to get
creative and let your design side shine! üë©‚Äçüé®


<div class="ordered-list">

1. Open the **app.less** file and let's add some custom CSS to target some HTML tags that were applied during the markdown to HTML conversion
2. Add the CSS from [link to github page]; alternatively, you can work with the tailwind.config.js file to customize HTML tag styles
3. Under the **templates** directory, create the following files
4. **_footer.peb** and add contents from [link to  github page]
5. **_header.peb** and add contents from [link to  github page]
6. **_nav.peb** and add contents from [link to  github page]
7. **blog.peb** and add contents from [link to  github page]
8. **editblog.peb** and add contents from [link to  github page]
9. **marked.peb** and add contents from [link to  github page]
10. **new.peb** and add contents from [link to  github page]
11. Modify **welcome.peb** by replacing current contents with contents from [link to  github page]

</div>

>/tip/ 
> If you change the css.less file or the tailwind.config.js file, you will need to recompile your project. You can do that by 
> installing yarn for your project and then run `yarn development` command

### [Step 9: Run the app and blog away!](#run-app)

Now for the fun part, run your new Blog Press website on you local environment and blog away!

If you want to take your blog all the way, do the following: 

<div class="ordered-list">

1. Add authentication and put the add/edit/remove blog post controls behind an authentication gate [https://alpas.dev/docs/authentication]
2. Provision a server and delpoy your code - see [deployment doc] for instructions
