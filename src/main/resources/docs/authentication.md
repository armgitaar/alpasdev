Alpas comes with authentication setup right out-of-box and requires you to do the absolute minimal work when it 
comes to adding authentication to your app. It is easy to get started with just one simple Alpas command.

Authentication sounds magical and complex but at the core mechanism is a very simple â€” you look for an id and you 
match the id. If the id matches, you fetch more information about that id and mark the current session being 
authenticated. And that's it!

However, there are few moving parts that make this magic work. Before we get into scaffolding an authentication 
boilerplate, let's talk about some core concepts that you need to understand about authentication first.

<a name="auth-channels-providers"></a>
### [Auth Channels and User Providers](#auth-channels-providers)


At the core, Alpas's authentication is divided into two parts - `auth channels` and `user providers`. Channels define 
how users are authenticated for each incoming request. `SessionAuthChannel` is an example of an authentication channel
that determines whether a user is authenticated or not based on sessions and cookies.

For a modern web app, only determining whether a user is an authenticated user or a guest is not enough. You need
to know more about the user as well. This is where providers come into play. They are responsible for retrieving
user information from a persistent storage such as database. Alpas ships with a `UserProvider` class already wired
to retrieve user info from a database.

<a name="authchannel"></a>
#### [Auth Channel](#authchannel)

Each `HttpCall` gets its own instance of an `AuthChannel` that you could use for authentication 
related tasks. `SessionAuthChannel` is one of the concrete implementations of `AuthChannel` but there could be more, 
including one of your own. The following methods are few of the methods available on `AuthChannel`. Let's see them
through the lens of `SessionAuthChannel` implementation.

<div class="sublist">

- `attempt(id: String, password: String): Boolean`

Attempts to find a user with the given `id` and `password`. If the user is found by the `UserProvider` by matching 
the id then it "hash matches" the given password and the hashed password saved by the `UserProvider`. If they match, 
it logs in the user and returns `true` otherwise returns `false`. 

Use this method to login a user if you already know the *id* and the *password*. For an example, the 
`LoginController` uses this method to login a user when the user signs in using a form.

- `check(): Boolean`

Checks whether a user is logged in or not. If not it attempts to login a user by looking up an id in the current
session and getting a user by that id from the `UserProvider` class.

Use this method if you want to check if the current session matches with a valid user or not. For an example,
`AuthOnlyMiddleware` uses this method to check the logged in user and forwards the call if session matches to an
existing user in the `UserProvider` otherwise it throws an exception.


- `isLoggedIn(): Boolean`

This call simply checks whether the session is an authenticated session or not. It doesn't attempt to lookup and
login a user.

- `login(user: Authenticatable)`

Logs in the given user. Use this method if you already have an `Authenticatable` object.

- `loginUsingId(id: Any) : Authenticatable?`

Attempts to fetch a user for the given `id` from the `UserProvider` and if it exists, logs in the user and returns
it as well. If the user couldn't be fetched, returns `null` instead.

- `logout()`

Logs out a user by invalidating the session. `LoginController` invokes this method when logging out a user. 
If you use this method directly, make sure to redirect the user to a different route as soon as you logout 
and **do not** touch the current session after logging out as the session is no longer valid.

</div>

<a name="userprovider"></a>
#### [User Provider](#userprovider)

A concrete implementation of `UserProvider` is responsible for fetching a user from a persistent store.
 
When we were talking about `AuthChannel`, notice how we didn't talk retrieving user from the database and this was
intentional. While for most of the apps it is true that you'd end up fetching users from a database but that just
the implementation details. `UserProvider`'s consumer doesn't care how you retrieve a user as long as you correctly
retrieve them. In fact, you can write your own implementation of `UserProvider` that looks up a user in a hashmap
if you want as long as your implementation provides following two methods:

<div class="sublist">

- `findByUsername(username: Any): Authenticatable?`

Find a user by the given `username`. The username could mean anything for your app and you get to definte it. For 
most of the web apps, it is an email address.

- `findByPrimaryKey(id: Any): Authenticatable?`

Find a user by the given primary key id. The primary key doesn't mean it has to be a primary key constraint in your
database but for most of the apps it is.

</div>

<a name="auth-channel-registration"></a>
#### [Auth Channel Registration](#auth-channel-registration)

You can configure what `AuthChannel` to use by default in multiple ways. 

When scaffolding a new project, Alpas creates an `AuthConfig` class for your. If you open it, you'll see that it adds 
a new channel under `session` name. Notice how the value of the channel is **not** an instance of `SessionAuthChannel`
but is a callback that creates the actual instance. 

As discussed earlier, a new instance of an auth channel is created for every call. This makes sense because each 
call could be associated with a different users so we don't want to share it among calls.

Also, notice how the second parameter is a `Users` object, which is a `UserProvider`. This means `SessionAuthChannel`
uses `Users` object when it needs to fetch an `Authenticatable` object. It just happens that `Users` object gets it
from the database!

Remember that when adding an auth channel all we are doing is registering a channel and **not** using it at this 
point. This means you could add another auth channel of your own and give a name of your own.

So how does Alpas know what auth channel to use? Well, you can decide what auth channel to apply by to all calls 
by setting `AUTH_CHANNEL` variable in your `.env` file. If you didn't set any, Alpas uses the name `session` by 
default. This is the reason why when registering an auth channel in `AuthConfig`, we named it `session` because 
that's the default!

<a name="httpcall-and-authentication"></a>
### [HttpCall and Authentication](#httpcall-and-authentication)

For most of the apps you'll never have to deal with all the concepts we talked about upto this point. Most of the 
times you are just concerned about whether the current user is authenticated or not and if authenticated who is
authenticated. `HttpCall` proxies all these for you so all you need is to know following properties:

<div class="sublist">

- `authChannel: AuthChannel`

Returns the auth channel that was applied to the current call. If no custom session is set for the current route,
it just returns the default session channel as configured in your `AuthConfig` class.

- `userProvider: UserProvider?`

Returns the user provider for the current call.

- `isAuthenticated: Boolean`

Returns `true` if the current call is authenticated. If not, returns `false`.

- `isFromGuest: Boolean`

Checks if the current call is from a guest; opposite of `isAuthenticated`.

- `user: Authenticatable`

Returns the current user if the call is authenticated. If not, aborts the call by throwing a 
`NotFoundHttpException`. If you don't want abort the call, only call this after checking `isAuthenticated` property.

</div>

<a name="custom-auth-channel"></a>
### [Custom Auth Channel](#custom-auth-channel)

To create a custom auth channel, you just need to implement `AuthChannel` interface and override couple of things.
The most important one being `check()` method.

Let's say we want to write an auth channel that checks **X-ADMIN-API-KEY** header of the incoming request and if it 
matches your API key then you consider this session to be authenticated and the user is authorized as an admin.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="4">

```kotlin

// AdminApiAuthChannel.kt
class AdminApiAuthChannel(private val call: HttpCall) : AuthChannel {
    override var user: Authenticatable? = null
    override fun check(): Boolean {
        val authHeader = call.header("X-ADMIN-API-KEY") ?: return false
        val isAuthenticated = 
        if(authHeader == "abracadabra"){
            // fetch the user somehow
            user = Users.findByRole("admin").firstOrNull()
        }
        return user != null
    }
}

```

</span>

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="2">

```kotlin

// src/main/kotlin/configs/AuthConfig.kt
class AuthConfig(env: Environment) : BaseConfig(env) {
    init {
        addChannel("session") { call -> AdminApiAuthChannel(call) }
    }
}

```

</span>

Now all `AdminApiAuthChannel` will be used for authentication.

<a name="route-auth-channels"></a>
### [Route Auth Channels](#route-auth-channels)

You may want to have multiple auth channels for your app depending on different routes. For an example, while
`SessionAuthChannel` may be appropriate for web routes, it may not be appropriate for API routes. API routes will 
probably use some other ways of validating a user â€” such as checking a personal token in the header rather than 
checking the cookies â€” and you might want a dedicated auth channel for this.

Alpas allows you to easily apply an auth channel for a specific route or a route group by passing an auth channel 
name to `mustBeAuthenticated()` method.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="6">

```kotlin

// routes.kt
fun Router.addRoutes() {
    // authenticate the user using an auth channel named "api"
    group("/api/docs") {
        get(DocsController::class)
    }.mustBeAuthenticated("api")

    // authenticate the user using an auth channel named "session"
    group("/web/admin") {
        get(ProfileController::class)
    }.mustBeAuthenticated("session")
}

```

</span>

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="2">

```kotlin

// src/main/kotlin/configs/AuthConfig.kt
class AuthConfig(env: Environment) : BaseConfig(env) {
    init {
        addChannel("session") { call -> SessionAuthChannel(call, Users) }
        addChannel("api") { call -> ApiAuthChannel(call) }
    }
}

```

</span>

> /tip/ <span> `alpas route:list` command shows more information about all your routes in a nicely formatted table.
> It also shows auth channel applied to each authorized only routes.</span>

<a name="authentication-middleware"></a>
### [Authentication Middleware](#authentication-middleware)

You need to assign `AuthOnlyMiddleware` to each of your routes that you want to have [accessible only to authorized 
users](/docs/routing#guarded-routes). If you want some of the routes to be accessible only for guests and not for 
authorized users then you need to apply `GuestOnlyMiddleware` instead.

`AuthConfig`'s `ifUnauthorizedRedirectToPath` property decides where to redirect unauthorized users trying to 
access authorized only routes. This is set to `/login` by default.

Similarly, `AuthConfig`'s `ifAuthorizedRedirectToPath` property decides where to redirect users who are already 
authorized but trying to access guests only routes. This is set to `/` by default. You are more than welcome to 
change these properties to fit your needs.
