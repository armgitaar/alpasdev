When your web application throws an exception, whether user initiated or not, Alpas tries its best to handle it
gracefully.

Based on the status code, it first converts it to a proper HTTP exception type, such as 
`NotFoundHttpException` for **404** error, `ValidationException` for **422** error, `MethodNotAllowedException` for 
**405** error, `InternalServerException` for **500** error etc. It then gives each exception a chance to `report` and 
then `render` the exception.

Each exception type does what's appropriate for it. Most of the exceptions return a 
message and a status code if the wanted response is a JSON request. For non-JSON response, different exceptions do
different things. Such as `ValidationException` [flashes errors and inputs](/docs/validation#errors-management) making 
it available to the next request. Both  `NotFoundHttpException` and `InternalServerException` render a beautiful error 
page.

 ### [Default Error Templates](#default-error-templates)
 
When you scaffold a new Alpas web app, two error templates for the most common HTTP exceptions - **404** and **500** - 
are created for you. They look great out of the box! However, you are more than welcome to modify it to make it fit
more with your app's branding.

These templates are under `src/main/resources/errors` directory. Feel free to change it to your heart's content!

### [Handling Exceptions](#handling-exceptions)

Alpas's default way of handling the exceptions may not work for you. You may want to tweak it or completely change the
behavior. Alpas allows you to easily intercept an exception being thrown and handle it the way you want it. This 
applies for both the built-in exceptions as well as your own custom exceptions.

To intercept an exception, you need to provide your own subclass of `dev.alpas.exceptions.ExceptionHandler` class and 
then override one or more of `report()`, `render()`, or `handle()` methods.

<div class="sublist">

- `report(exception: HttpException, call: HttpCall)`

Override this method to log or send the given HTTP exception to an external service like [Bugsnag](https://bugsnag.com),
[Sentry](https://sentry.io) etc. By default, the `report()` method passes the exception to the base class which then
calls the `report()` method on the exception itself. Most of the built-in exceptions just write logs a message either
as a warning or as an error.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="5">

```kotlin

// src/main/kotlin/exceptions/ExceptionHandler.kt
class ExceptionHandler : dev.alpas.exceptions.ExceptionHandler() {
    override fun report(exception: HttpException, call: HttpCall) {
        when (exception) {
            is NotFoundHttpException -> call.logger.warn { "This resource is missing!" }
            is ValidationException -> call.logger.warn { "The input is invalid!" }
            is MyCustomException -> ThirdPartyLogger.log(exception)
            else -> super.report(exception, call)
        }
    }
}

```

</span>

- `render(exception: HttpException, call: HttpCall)`

Override this method to generate an HTTP response for the given exception and to send it back to the client. If you 
want to render a template for an exception, this is the place to do it. In fact, this is how the default **404** and
**500** error pages are rendered by Alpas.

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="5">

```kotlin

// src/main/kotlin/exceptions/ExceptionHandler.kt
class ExceptionHandler : dev.alpas.exceptions.ExceptionHandler() {
    override fun render(exception: HttpException, call: HttpCall) {
        when (exception) {
            is MyCustomException -> call.render("errors/custom_error", 418)
            else -> super.render(exception, call)
        }
    }
}

```

</span>

- `handle(exception: Throwable, call: HttpCall)`

Override this method if you want to handle a non-http exception. You may be throwing a particular type of exception 
from different parts of your web app. This method would be the perfect place to handle that type of exception in one
central place. By default, this method converts any non-HTTP exception to a catch-all `InternalServerException` and
reports and renders it accordingly.

</div>

> /tip/ <span> Your custom `ExceptionHandler` class could live anywhere in your package but we recommend putting it 
> under `src/main/kotlin/exceptions` directory. Don't worry about loading this class. Alpas will automatically 
> discover, load, and use this class for you!

### [Throwing HTTP Exceptions](#throwing-http-exceptions)

Use `HttpCall`'s one of many [abort()](/docs/http-response#abort) methods to throw an HTTP exception.

<a name="stacktrace-dump"></a>
### [Stacktrace Dump](#stacktrace-dump)

When rendering an `InternalServerException`, if your app environment is in dev mode, it dumps the stacktrace to your
web page. This makes it easy to just see what's going on without having to resort to your IDE's console. You can
control whether the stacktrace gets dumped to your web page or not by setting a proper value for `APP_LEVEL` variable
in your `.env` file. Setting it to one of **dev**, **debug**, or **local** dumps the stacktrace but setting it to one
of **prod**, **production**, or **live** doesn't.

> /alert/ <span>Make sure to set `APP_LEVEL` to one of **prod**, **production**, or **live** once your app is deployed
> and is live.</span>
